# Project2_API's and Cloud Computing

This project will focus on API's and Cloud Computing.

Cloud Computing is an important aspect of tech in workspaces as most people can now work away from the office. This means that people shoukd have access to resources from wherever they are, ensuring that they can work together and efficiently. This has also helped companies save on overhead costs they would have paid for if they were working in offices. It is a fast spreading concept and manner of approach to collaborative work.
